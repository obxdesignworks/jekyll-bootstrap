The switcher is responsible for switching themes for your website.
This solution is unideal because we have to manually add
themes to the switcher case statement in order for it to work.
Reason is Jekyll's custom 'include' tag does not support passing in variables as its argument.
So we can't include a file using a dynamic filename.

Usage:
  To add a theme just follow the same case logic but update the theme-name.

Proposed Fix:
  There are two easy fixes for this but they will need to be included into Jekyll core
  and I haven't submitted a pull request yet. The fix will not break or harm anything:

  1. Add ability to specify custom '_layouts' path. Jekyll configuration
    already supports a custom _plugins path. The same can be applied to the layouts folder.
    This let's us namespace our _layouts folder by theme.
    Example:
      layouts : _layouts/hellokitty
  
    The hellokitty folder defines a standardized set of layout files and presto we have ability
    to install themes.

  2. Update install Liquid tag to support variable parsing. This way we can pass in a variable
    that essentially namespaces include files. 

  I vote for #1 since it's easier and there's less abstraction.
